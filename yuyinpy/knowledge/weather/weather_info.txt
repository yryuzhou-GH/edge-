# Weather Information

## Weather Terminology

### Basic Terms
- **Temperature**: Measure of how hot or cold the air is
- **Humidity**: Amount of water vapor in the air
- **Precipitation**: Any form of water that falls from clouds (rain, snow, sleet, etc.)
- **Barometric Pressure**: The pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere
- **Wind Speed**: How fast the air is moving, usually measured in mph or km/h
- **Wind Direction**: The direction from which the wind is blowing

### Weather Phenomena
- **Thunderstorm**: A storm with thunder and lightning, typically accompanied by heavy rain
- **Hurricane/Typhoon**: A large tropical storm with strong winds rotating around a center of low pressure
- **Tornado**: A violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud
- **Fog**: A cloud at ground level that reduces visibility
- **Hail**: Solid precipitation in the form of ice pellets
- **Drought**: A prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall
- **Blizzard**: A severe snowstorm with high winds and low visibility

## Seasonal Weather Patterns

### Spring (March-May in Northern Hemisphere)
- Gradually warming temperatures
- Increased rainfall
- More daylight hours
- Possibility of thunderstorms

### Summer (June-August in Northern Hemisphere)
- Highest temperatures of the year
- Longer daylight hours
- Potential for heat waves
- In tropical regions: monsoon season with heavy rainfall

### Fall/Autumn (September-November in Northern Hemisphere)
- Gradually cooling temperatures
- Decreasing daylight hours
- Often drier than spring/summer
- Potential for early frost or snow in colder regions

### Winter (December-February in Northern Hemisphere)
- Lowest temperatures of the year
- Shortest daylight hours
- Potential for snow, ice storms, and blizzards
- In tropical regions: often the dry season

## Climate Zones

- **Tropical**: Hot and humid year-round, near the equator
- **Subtropical**: Hot summers and mild winters
- **Temperate**: Four distinct seasons with moderate temperature variations
- **Continental**: Hot summers and cold winters with large temperature variations
- **Polar**: Very cold year-round, near the poles
- **Desert**: Hot days, cold nights, very little precipitation
- **Mountain**: Temperature decreases with elevation, varied precipitation

## Weather Forecasting

Modern weather forecasting uses a combination of:
- Satellite imagery
- Radar systems
- Weather stations
- Computer models
- Historical data analysis

Forecasts typically become less accurate the further into the future they predict, with good accuracy for 1-3 days, moderate accuracy for 4-7 days, and limited accuracy beyond that.
